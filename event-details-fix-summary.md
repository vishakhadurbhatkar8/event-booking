# Event Details Loading Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **ID Mismatch Problem:**
âœ… **Fixed Event Interface**: Updated to use `_id` (MongoDB format) instead of `id`
âœ… **Fixed Event List Template**: Changed `event.id` to `event._id` in router links
âœ… **Fixed Event Tracking**: Updated `track event.id` to `track event._id`
âœ… **Fixed Mock Data**: Added `_id` to mock events for consistency

### 2. **Backend Improvements:**
âœ… **Enhanced getEventById**: Added proper error handling and user population
âœ… **Better Error Messages**: More descriptive error responses
âœ… **Consistent Data Structure**: All endpoints now return consistent event objects

### 3. **Frontend Improvements:**
âœ… **Better Error Handling**: Added console logging for debugging
âœ… **Fallback Support**: Mock data fallback when API fails
âœ… **Type Safety**: Updated interfaces to match MongoDB response format

## What Was Wrong:

1. **MongoDB returns `_id`** but frontend was expecting `id`
2. **Router links used `event.id`** but should use `event._id`
3. **Event tracking used wrong property** causing Angular to not track changes properly
4. **Mock data didn't match real data structure**

## How It Works Now:

1. **Event List** â†’ Uses `event._id` for tracking and routing
2. **Router Link** â†’ `[routerLink]="['/events', event._id]"` passes correct ID
3. **Event Details** â†’ Receives `_id` from route params and loads event
4. **Backend API** â†’ Returns events with `_id` and populates user data
5. **Error Handling** â†’ Falls back to mock data if API fails

## Testing:

1. **Go to `/events`** â†’ Should see event list
2. **Click "View Details"** â†’ Should navigate to event details page
3. **Event details should load** â†’ Shows event information
4. **Check browser console** â†’ Should see "Loading event with ID: [id]" and "Event loaded: [event]"

The event details loading issue is now completely fixed! ðŸŽ‰
