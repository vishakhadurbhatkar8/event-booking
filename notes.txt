6. Quick Test

Run ng serve

Navigate to /events → event list placeholder

Open DevTools → check localStorage (empty)

Try /bookings → should redirect to blank (guard blocks navigation, Angular will not allow route if false)

Set a fake token in DevTools:

localStorage.setItem('token', 'test');


Refresh /bookings → now loads the Booking Dashboard page.

✅ Core infrastructure is ready.
